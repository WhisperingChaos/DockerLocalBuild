# Until an automated method becomes available, the list below must
# enumerate all Components within this project and order them
# from most to least dependent relative to all the other ones
# named in this list.  Please ensure that the component also 
# appears as a target of a rule below.
#
# Replace <ComponentName> with the desired one below.
COMPONENT_LST:=<ComponentName>.img


# Add a Component rule below to incorporate it into the project managed by this makefile.
# The Component name must also appear as an element in the "COMPONENT_LST" above.
#
# In general, no prerequisite dependencies should be specified, as the default
# rule for .img targets encodes a wildcard specifier which includes any file/directory 
# mentioned in the Component's directory.  Please see the README.md file
# for more detailed instructions.  Also view the Component file available in the
# sample project's tar file: "sample.tar.gz".
#
# Replace <ComponentName> with the desired one below.
